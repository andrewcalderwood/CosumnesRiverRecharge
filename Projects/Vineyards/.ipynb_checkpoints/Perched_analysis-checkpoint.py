# # Goal
# We've had more and more discussion about the water becoming return flows and also the delineation of water level recovery due to natural and managed recharge.
# 1. We can begin to identify return flows by comparing groundwater elevations to stream thalwegs (initial check appears to suggest groundwater may come to 5-15 ft of the thalweg depending the year. At 5 ft that is within the bounds of uncertainty of causing reconnection with losing conditions.
# 2. We can investigate the source of recharge with time series analysis/correlations or numerical modeling (MODFLOW-USG or another software with perching enabled).

# # Stream-aquifer connectivity
# - load groundwater elevation data and 1m DEM data
# - spatial analysis assuming constant GWL in paleochannel (use DP-NMR for justification of contuity or gradient in paleochannel)
# - consider variability of streambed thickness (AEM data?)
